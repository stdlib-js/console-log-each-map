    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

```javascript
import logEachMap from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/console-log-each-map@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### logEachMap( str\[, ...args], clbk\[, thisArg] )

Inserts array element values and the result of a callback function into a format string and prints the result.

```javascript
function add( a, b ) {
    return a + b;
}

var x = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
var y = [ 4, 5, 6 ];

logEachMap( '%d + %d = %d', x, y, add );
// e.g., => '1 + 4 = 5\n2 + 5 = 7\n3 + 6 = 9\n'
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **str**: format string.
-   **args**: input arrays _(optional)_.
-   **clbk**: callback function.
-   **thisArg**: callback execution context _(optional)_.

To set the callback execution context, provide a `thisArg`.

<!-- eslint-disable no-invalid-this -->

```javascript
function count( x, y ) {
    this.count += 1;
    return x + y;
}

var x = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
var y = [ 4, 5, 6 ];

var ctx = {
    'count': 0
};

logEachMap( '%d + %d = %d', x, y, count, ctx );
// e.g., => '1 + 4 = 5\n2 + 5 = 7\n3 + 6 = 9\n'

var v = ctx.count;
// returns 3
```

If an interpolated argument is not an array-like object, the argument is broadcasted for each iteration.

```javascript
function multiply( x, y ) {
    return x * y;
}

var x = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
var y = 2;

logEachMap( '%d * %d = %d', x, y, multiply );
// e.g., => '1 * 2 = 2\n2 * 2 = 4\n3 * 2 = 6\n'
```

The callback function is provided the following arguments:

-   **arg0**: current array element for the first broadcasted array.
-   **arg1**: current array element for the second broadcasted array.
-   **...argN**: current array element for the nth broadcasted array.
-   **index**: current element index.
-   **arrays**: broadcasted arrays. If an argument was broadcasted, the corresponding array is a single-element generic array containing the original element.

The number of `argX` arguments is determined according to the number of provided `args` arguments. If no `args` are provided, the callback is invoked without any arguments.

## Notes

-   If the function is provided array-like objects of unequal lengths, the function throws an error.
-   The function supports array-like objects supporting the accessor protocol (e.g., [`Complex128Array`][@stdlib/array/complex128], [`Complex64Array`][@stdlib/array/complex64], etc).
